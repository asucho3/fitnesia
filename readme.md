# About Fitnesia

This is a landing page featuring some commonly seen components such as accordion, carrousel, etc.

Making this static website was actually a great exercise (pun intended) in order to master the use of vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML

The website makes use of a responsive design, more specifically targeting phone screens with a screen size of 340px.

# How to Install and Run the Project

first, install dependencies:

```
npm i
```

then run live server from the project directory:

```
live-server
```

if you get an error ("scripts disabled on this system"), you'll need to bypass execution policy:

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\Users\(your username)\AppData\Roaming\npm\live-server.ps1
```
